# Achievement-6 : Chocolate-bar-ratings

# Project Summary: 
Analyzing Factors Influencing Chocolate Bar Ratings (2006–2017)

This project explores the key factors that influence chocolate bar ratings using data from 2006 to 2017. The analysis investigates how cocoa percentage (CocoaPercent), bean origin (BroadOrigin), bean type (BeanType), and company location relate to the overall rating of chocolate bars.
The goal is to uncover patterns behind chocolate quality and see if we can predict a bar’s rating just from its key ingredients and origins — turning data into insights!

# Data Source and Collection 
The Chocolate Bar Ratings dataset was obtained from Kaggle (chocolate-bar ratings). It contains 1,795 sensory reviews of 440 unique chocolate bars, contributed by a community of chocolate enthusiasts between 2006 and 2017.

# Folders

04 Analysis: All the visuals from analysis.

# Questions to Explore:

•How does CocoaPercent correlate with Rating?

•What is the trend in average ratings from 2006 to 2017?
